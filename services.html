<p> <h3>Laurie wants to help you as much as you need</h3> </p>

<p> <h4>Through the process</h4> </p>

<p>Each stage of the college planning process carries different priorities. Laurie recognizes that each student's situation is different, and she offers customized guidance while also providing an overview of the process. While <b>academic preparation is first and foremost</b>, extracurricular and career exploration activities are also important. By far the most critical theme, however, is the student developing self-understanding and building critical life skills in the personal, social, and "real life" realms. For <b>success in college</b>, developing grit, a positive mindset, effective behaviors, and a strong support system is key.</p>

<p>Laurie guides students through the process, helping them to <b>learn</b> what's needed, <b>do</b> what's needed, and <b>follow through</b> with what's needed to apply. Whether a student applies only to California State Universities or to an array of private and public institutions with many required essays, letters of recommendation, coach outreach, supplemental talent submissions, and merit scholarship opportunities, an experienced and organized advisor can help.</p>

<p> <h4>Transition</h4> </p>

<p>Transitioning to college can bring both <b>excitement</b> and <b>uncertainty</b>. Laurie can guide both students and parents at this stage, allaying concerns and laying groundwork for success in college and in life.</p>

<p> <h3>Career planning</h3> </p>

<p>Planning for a career, whether as a high school student, college student, or no-longer-a-student, can range from exciting to nerve-racking. Understanding one's values, interests, personality, temperament, and practical requirements is important to finding a path to a <b>happy and fulfilling career</b>. Laurie works with clients to understand themselves and to identify career possibilities, explore careers, and to develop a path to prepare for a career.</p>
