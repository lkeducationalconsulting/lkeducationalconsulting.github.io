For Fall 2017 Applicants! Important info about your applications!
 
Hello to my applicants (and families) for fall 2017! I hope the fall semester and application season is going well for everyone, and that you are feeling confident and optimistic about your college options. 

I've been meeting with most of you to review your record and college list, to develop your plan for applying, and to help complete and review your applications before submitting, but please email me if you need to schedule a meeting time. While it's a busy season, I do give priority to meeting with seniors - especially as the application deadlines near!

Please note that I won't be available to meet from November 24 - Nov. 27 and from December 23 - January 1 because of the holidays. Please plan ahead - especially seniors working toward those pesky application deadlines at the end of November and beginning of January.

Your college list - a good academic and social fit, affordable (parents! figure this out now while there is still time to apply elsewhere), and where you would really go

Your list of colleges where you intend to apply should be finalized now or very soon - representing a thoughtful list of schools in terms of academics, student life, admissions chances, affordability, and where you will actually be willing to attend. You should have a target timeline for completing your applications, all of which are open now.

Parents - you should know where, why, and when your student is applying to college, how much it may cost, and how you will pay for it. If you would like to meet to discuss any of these, please let me know.

Getting lots of emails and invitations for VIP, Priority, Fast-Track applications?

It's up to you to choose where you apply, not just respond to marketing offers. Take advantage of them when the college fits your needs, but realize that these offers do not guarantee admission, sometimes do not qualify you for merit scholarship consideration, and are sent to many applicants.

Check your transcripts for accuracy - before they get sent to colleges

Check your transcripts from every school where you have taken courses: high school, community college, online providers. Ask for an unofficial copy.

Official transcripts from every high school and college attended may need to be submitted in support of your application (not for CSU and UC and certain other schools unless specifically requested, and for the Common App, current high school transcripts are submitted by the school as part of the School Report).

This year's courses!

Are they entered correctly on your application? If you have already submitted applications, have your course plans changed since you applied? You MUST advise your colleges of any changes. Not doing so could cause your offer of admission to be rescinded if your final transcripts do not match the application info.

Test score reports - VERY IMPORTANT

Request your OFFICIAL test scores be sent from the testing agency (CollegeBoard.org for SAT and Subject Tests, ACT.org for ACT) to arrive before the college's deadline. 

Parents! Test score reports require a FEE so this is something families need to take care of outside of meetings with me.

Please see me if you have questions about sending your scores - it is not always as simple as it may appear and there are ways to save money.

Applying Early Action or Early Decision?

If you are applying Early Action or Early Decision, aim to have all of materials at the school by the deadline - application, letters of rec, test scores, etc. Many schools are very strict on this and these deadlines are NOW or SOON.

This means making sure you have given your recommenders ample time and information to write effective recommendations (NOT generic letters referencing your extracurriculars!). Please see me for help with this as well as the strategy for which letters go where and when. 

Submitting applications

Do NOT wait until the last day to submit! Do NOT wait until the last day to submit! Do NOT wait until the last day to submit! 

Check that all the application requirements have been met, including possible interviews. Follow up after your apply to avoid problems and to enhance your admission chances - for some schools, this can be very important.

Athletes!

I hope you are enjoying exploring opportunities to play sports in college, but I know that many students also feel a lot of pressure from coaches, especially during Official Visits. Remember to keep calm and focus on your own priorities, which may not be the same as the coach's. Keep in mind that no matter what the coach says, you still need to get past the admissions office too so keep up that part of the application process.

Paying for college - think about it now rather than regret it later!

Parents - I have met with many of you to discuss ways to pay for college and the financial aid (need-based and merit aid) process, but am happy to meet with you either again or for the first time to discuss concerns you may have. 

The FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) and CSS Profile (another app required by some private schools) are both open and you should complete them asap. 

The calendar year 2015 is the base year for students applying for fall 2017 and the FAFSA will link to your tax returns. Log in to Guided Path for a summary of financial aid and deadlines. 

Students - check the college websites and your high school for scholarship opportunities. Most deadlines are later in the fall but now is the time to explore (we'll do this together as well). 

Some upcoming events - check your college websites for other possible options:

•   Be on the lookout for visits from college admissions reps at your school (they are often people who read your application) and for local receptions or information sessions like the ones below. Sign up with your schools of interest so they know to contact you about upcoming events. 

•   Individual interviews with college representatives may be offered and they fill up fast (e.g., popular ones are Chapman, Lewis and Clark). See me for how to prepare for possible meetings or interviews.
