<br>

<h4>Approach to college planning:</h4>

<p>Laurie's approach to the college search process is based on finding <b>colleges that are good fits for students as individuals</b>. Rather than living life for the sake of a college application, Laurie encourages students to live and develop their own lives, following their own interests and values. By guiding them to understand themselves and take advantage of opportunities to learn and grow, Laurie helps them to identify schools that will provide a range of options where they will be fulfilled, challenged, happy, and successful. Laurie extends this approach to <b>career planning</b> for college students and adults as well.</p>

<p>In keeping with this view, Laurie encourages students and families to help themselves in the college planning and application process. As explained under <a href="services.html" title="Go to the Services page">Services</a>, she does not commit clients to packages or plans for a fixed number of meetings. While still providing overall guidance, she works on an <b>hourly</b> basis so clients can use her services <b>to the extent they choose</b>.</p>

<p>To develop a personal understanding of colleges and universities, Laurie <a href="collegesvisited.html" title="Go to the Colleges Visited page">visits many college campuses</a> every year. Schools range across the U.S. and Canada, comprising small liberal arts schools, specialty art or engineering schools, and large research universities. </p>

<h3>Laurie's experience working with clients</h3>
 
<p>
Laurie works with <b>high school students</b>, <b>college students</b>, and <b>adults</b>. She advises students on academic interests, identifying good-fit colleges, the college search process, financial aid, how to portray oneself on the application, and choosing among offers. <br>
<br>
Laurie's clients represent a wide range of backgrounds, academic abilities, and talents - from <b>engineers</b> to <b>equestrians</b>, from <b>top athletes</b> to <b>video game designers</b>. Students come from high schools across <span itemprop="address" itemscope
      itemtype="http://data-vocabulary.org/Address">
      <span itemprop="locality">Santa Cruz</span> County, 
      <span itemprop="region">CA</span> and beyond, with traditional U.S. high school curricula as well as the <b>Advanced Placement</b> (AP), <b>International Baccalaureate</b> (IB) and <b>French Baccalaureate</b> (French Bacc) programs.  High schools include <span itemprop="address" itemscope
      itemtype="http://data-vocabulary.org/Address">
      <span itemprop="locality">San Lorenzo Valley, Scotts Valley, Santa Cruz, Georgiana Bruce Kirby, Pacific Collegiate, Harbor, Soquel, Aptos, Pajaro Valley, Pacific Coast Charter, Watsonville, and others outside Santa Cruz County</span>. Laurie enjoys working with <b>athletes</b> and many of her students go on to play sports in college. <br>
</p>

<p>Laurie encourages students to learn to help themselves, providing ample guidance and suggestions while guiding them to build skills for learning and decision-making. The process is itself a learning experience, preparing students for the next stage. <br>

 <h3>Additional counseling background that sets Laurie apart</h3>
<p>
Laurie is especially interested in <b>factors influencing college success</b>. Her M.A. thesis focused on the importance of non-cognitive factors, characteristics that can play a role that is equally if not even more important than the academic record. Her experience <b>working with college students</b> at the University of California at Santa Cruz and San Jose State University is invaluable in understanding the opportunities and challenges that await students on the other side of college freshman orientation. <br>
<br>
With an advanced degree in educational counseling, Laurie is <b>certified to administer and interpret</b> professional psychometric assessments. Laurie uses the professional-level <b>Strong Interest Inventory</b> and <b>Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)</b> to help with college and career planning. In contrast to assessments available to the general public, the Strong and MBTI are built on rigorous psychometric testing and ongoing refinement. Laurie also offers the YouScience assessment, an in-depth evaluation of aptitudes, interests, and career opportunities that is specifically tailored to young adults.<br>
<br>
Laurie is also a <b>parent</b> with children in college and beyond. She draws on her personal experience and understanding of both the opportunities and challenges facing high school and college students. She is sensitive to the family concerns and issues that can arise in the college and career planning processes.<br>

<br>

 <h3>Beyond college and career planning</h3>
 
<p>
Laurie is a <b>scientist</b> as well as a <b>counselor</b>, with her path to educational counseling arising in part from guiding students to science careers. Laurie's professional experience includes many years of working in <b>natural environments</b> and with <b>engineers</b>. As a professional biologist, her work has focused on studies related to native California flora and rare plant species including rare species assessments, botanical resource management, habitat restoration and biological impact assessment. Other experience includes marine biological studies, marine intertidal field assessments, and aquaculture of selected marine algal species. Laurie is also an environmental educator for K-12 and older students.<br>

<p>Laurie has a wide range of interests, which helps her to relate to students with a wide range of interests. In addition to her family and friends, some of her favorites are swimming, swimming in the ocean, science, kayaking, sailing, hiking, botanizing, mountain biking, yoga, reading, learning languages (over and over), traveling, and cats.<br>

<h3>About the logo</h3>


<p>The flower in the logo is <i>Lewisia rediviva</i> Pursh, commonly known as "bitterroot," a species native to California. The specific epithet <i>"rediviva"</i> is from the Latin "renovated, reborn, or restored to life" because of the way the plant dies back after flowering and then grows and blooms again the following year. Many thanks to photographer Daniel Mosquin of the <a href="http://www.botanicalgarden.ubc.ca" target="_blank" title="UBC Botanical Garden">Botanical Garden of the University of British Columbia</a> for the use of his image.</p>
