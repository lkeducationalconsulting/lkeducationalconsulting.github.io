<p><h4>Planning for a change</h4></p>


<p>Transfer students have many opportunities. They also face challenges that are in some ways more complex and in other ways more straightforward than freshman applicants.</p>

<p>Laurie guides students to understand their <b>reasons and goals for transferring</b>, to identify programs and colleges that will <b>fit their needs and preferences</b>, and to complete <b>effective applications</b>. She works with the student and family to understand the academic, social, and financial aspects of the transfer process as well as the option of taking time off.</p>

<p>The transfer process varies among different types of four-year colleges and the <b>admission criteria are different</b> compared with applying to college as a freshman. Some institutions (e.g., the California State University and University of California systems) accept only <b>junior-level transfers</b>, with priority and transfer pipelines available for California community college students. Other colleges accept transfer students even with <b>only a few college units</b>.</p>

<p>Admission criteria focus on the <b>college academic record</b> and often on <b>preparation for specific college majors</b> at the target institution. It is important for prospective transfer students to explore potential majors and take the appropriate college courses at the home institution before applying to transfer.</p>

<p>Planning for transferring, whether from a California community college or another four-year institution, is best done as soon as possible. Laurie can help to <b>develop a transfer plan</b> as well as to <b>implement it</b>, depending on the needs of the student.</p>
